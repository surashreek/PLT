Spring 2015 COMS W4115, Programming Languages & Translators with Prof. Alfred Aho

CalPhy primarily aims to help students solve introductory Physics problems. The language provides the user the ability to lay out the basics information of a physics problem and use the builtin functionality to solve it, or use the language explicitly to solve the problem. The topics covered by CalPhy are:

Motion along a straight line.
a. Vectors
b. Motion in two dimensions.
c. Force and Motion
d. Kinetic Energy and Work
e. Potential Energy and Conservation of Work
